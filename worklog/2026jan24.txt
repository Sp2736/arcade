On this day, I broke down the project into smaller, manageable modules and outlined their individual responsibilities. For each module, I identified core functionalities, required data, and interaction patterns. This helped in prioritizing development order and avoiding feature overlap. The groundwork for starting actual module construction was prepared, keeping scalability and maintainability in mind.
