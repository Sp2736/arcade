On this day, I revisited the core objectives and scope of the ARCADE project to realign the user interface with the actual problem statement. I analyzed how different user roles (students, faculty, HOD, admin) would interact with the system and noted expectations from the home page itself. This helped in identifying what information should be surfaced immediately versus what should remain module-specific. Initial thoughts around layout structure, navigation hierarchy, and overall user experience were drafted.
