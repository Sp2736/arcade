Today’s work focused on strengthening the student experience by refining profile management, roadmap-driven progress tracking, and skill progression logic across the platform. I simplified navigation by removing the standalone Settings module and integrating password management directly within the user profile, including secure visibility toggling and edit controls that are accessible only in explicit edit mode. Profile updates were constrained using time-based locks to prevent frequent changes, allowing general edits only after 24 hours and restricting target role changes for one week unless completion conditions are met.

I introduced a structured Target Role / Target Skills selection mechanism, enabling users to align their learning journey with predefined roadmaps. Once selected, this role drives progress mapping on the Overview page and dynamically updates Roadmap content. Role modification logic was tied to learning outcomes, allowing changes only after all mandatory skills and at least two advanced skills are completed, ensuring meaningful engagement rather than random switching.

The Roadmap module was significantly enhanced both functionally and visually. Mandatory, advanced, and optional skill sets were clearly segregated, each containing checklist-based tracking for completed learnings. Skill sets were unlocked progressively, with only mandatory skills accessible initially, while others remained blurred with visible lock indicators. Newly unlocked sections were highlighted using a “NEW!!” stamp until the first skill completion, guiding user attention. A contextual guidance note was added to promote honest self-assessment during progress tracking.

I further elevated user motivation by engineering full-screen celebration effects for skill completion. Confetti and congratulations animations were redesigned to occupy the entire screen for a fixed duration, temporarily disabling interaction to emphasize achievement. Three distinct celebration variants were implemented for mandatory, advanced, and optional skill completions, each with appropriate messaging and enhanced firework effects. Responsiveness issues in the Roadmap module were addressed to ensure consistent visuals and usability across large screens, tablets, and smaller devices. Final polish included fixing dropdown color visibility and refining lock icon placement to maintain clarity even on blurred sections.
