The final day of this period was focused on consolidating all previous work and preparing for implementation. I reviewed the finalized home page design, confirmed theme consistency, and cross-checked module plans against project objectives. By the end of the day, I was fully prepared to begin module-wise construction in the upcoming week, with a clear roadmap and defined development direction.
