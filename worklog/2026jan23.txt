With the home page design completed, I shifted focus towards planning the next phase of development. I identified key modules to be developed next and mapped how each module would integrate with the home page navigation. This included defining module entry points, expected user flows, and dependencies between modules. This planning ensured a smooth transition from UI design to functional construction.
