Today’s work concluded with a focused effort on refining the overall user experience and visual polish of the student-side interface. I reworked the navigation behavior to restore a hamburger-style sidebar for smaller screens, ensuring smooth usability across mobiles, tablets, and iPad-sized devices without compromising desktop layouts.

Significant attention was given to enhancing visual depth and interactivity by planning and engineering a fluid, cursor-responsive background that softly glows in the project’s themed blue color. Separate visual palettes were defined for light and dark themes, maintaining a white-based fluid background for light mode and a black-based palette for dark mode so that glow effects remain subtle yet effective.

I further improved the dark theme by adding richer stylings, smoother transitions, and refined visual effects to elevate the overall feel of the interface. Existing student layouts were preserved structurally, while focused “wow” effects were introduced through animations, hover interactions, and motion cues to enhance engagement without affecting usability. Finally, I standardized spacing by fixing padding, margins, and layout gaps across all components, ensuring consistent rendering and comfortable viewing on small screens, tablets, and large displays alike.
