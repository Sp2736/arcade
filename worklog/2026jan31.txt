Today’s work was focused on structuring and laying the foundation for the student-side module of the ARCADE project. I designed the complete skeleton for student-facing components and organized them into a clear, scalable directory structure, separating dashboard-specific logic from home-level components. Core student dashboard views such as overview, notes, roadmaps, skill navigation, resume resources, and profile handling were created as independent components to ensure modularity and easier future extension.

Alongside structural work, I worked on UX-level refinements for the Resource Vault. I planned visual indicators to clearly distinguish uploader roles by replacing generic note icons with explicit “Faculty” and “Student” stamps, improving content clarity at a glance. I also enhanced metadata visibility on resource cards by introducing an “Approved By” field to display the verifying faculty for student-uploaded materials, reinforcing trust and accountability in shared content.

Additionally, I addressed UI consistency issues by planning a proper color palette for dropdown elements and improving hover-state visibility for toggle actions like Browse Library / My Uploads in light mode, where default greys lacked contrast. I removed the redundant “Search Nodes” element from the top bar and designed a notification system to surface recent uploads across materials, roadmaps, and resumes, including uploader and verifier details. Special attention was given to first-time user experience by defining a session-based notification flow that initially shows a warm greeting and then transitions to contextual updates, with notifications expiring per session unless manually dismissed by the user.
