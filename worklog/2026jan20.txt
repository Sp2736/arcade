I worked on conceptualizing the home page structure in detail, focusing on clarity, simplicity, and role-awareness. Major sections such as introduction, feature highlights, quick access modules, and call-to-action elements were planned. I also evaluated existing academic and career platforms to understand common UI patterns and usability practices. Based on this analysis, I finalized the basic content flow and placement logic for the ARCADE home page.
